# HandCricketGame

The Hand Cricket game is a Python project that combines Tkinter for the user interface and OpenCV for hand gesture detection. The game mimics traditional cricket using hand gestures, where players score runs or take wickets based on matching gestures with randomly generated numbers by the computer. It supports both single-player and two-player modes, allowing players to compete against each other or the computer.
